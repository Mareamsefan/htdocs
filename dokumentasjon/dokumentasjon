____What we have done (so far)____
We started working on this project by creating a basic sketch of what 
the page should look like, including neccessary functionalities, in MS Paint.

Our first step was creating a repository in GitHub, and inviting
all of our members to it. We then all installed and configured XAMPP
on our computers, so that we would be able to edit and get instant feedback
on our changes without the need to upload to the server and having to
use a VPN to connect to it.

We then went on to create some static HTML and CSS pages without any
functionality. We created a mysql database in MySQL-workbench with 
the information we needed for the website to work. This database
was updated multiple times during the development of the project.
With the SQL-database in place, we got to working on functionality.

We used chatGPT throughout the project to more efficiently learn
PHP syntax and discover various useful methods that exist within
PHP version 8.

We had weekly meetings where we would discuss in person what we 
thought needed to be done, assign tasks, and help each
other if we were stuck. We met every tuesday and thursday,
but also set up a few meetings on other days when
we felt it was neccessary.
